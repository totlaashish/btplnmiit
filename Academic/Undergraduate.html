                                    currently being followed, is given in BTech-Programme. However, the semester-wise
                                    structure is not followed rigidly. In fact, the students are encouraged to change
                                    the structure of their curriculum, to the extent feasible and desirable, to accommodate
                                    their own aspirations. The curriculum of every academic Programme is reviewed, periodically,
                                    with a view to incorporate the latest advances pertaining to the Programme.

                                        in the light of the broad goals, as stated in the introduction. The financial implications
                                        are also examined by the AC EPC. The recommendations of the AC EPC are considered
                                        by the AC. The AC, when convinced, makes suitable recommendations to the Governing
                                        Council of the Institute for starting a new undergraduate Programme. A new undergraduate
                                        Programme can be started only after obtaining the necessary approval from the
                                        Governing Council (GC).

                                        without any SGPA stipulation if there is no clash in the time table. However, this is not a right of the students.

                                        a facility which is meant to help deserving students. The make - up examination
                                        cannot be demanded as a matter of right. If a student is not able to appear in mid/end
                                        term examination(s), due to valid reasons, he/she may request the Instructor - in
                                        - Charge of the course for a make - up examination. The Instructor - incharge
                                        of the course, if convinced of the reasons given by the student, may arrange a make
                                        - up examination at his/her discretion. All end - term make up exams require approval
                                        of Dean Academic. Makeup examinations would be administered one week before January
                                        - May semester for the courses of July - November odd semester and two weeks after
                                        January - May even semester. For Mid Term make - up examination(s), the Instructor
                                        - incharge of a course may use any means to ascertain the progress of such student
                                        but for End Term make - up examination(s), such a student needs to write three hour

                                        by the AC UGC at the end of each semester. The primary purpose of this review is
                                        to help the students, to the extent possible.
                                                                </p>

                                        as shown in the structure of the curriculum of each B. Tech. Programme. At the end
                                        of each semester, the backlog of a student refers to the shortfall in these credits
                                        due to 'F' grades obtained by the student in some course(s).

                                        B. Tech. Programme in at the most six years. However, if a student does not complete
                                        all the graduation requirements even in six years, the AC may terminate the Programme of such a student. The decision to terminate the Programme of any student
                                        is taken after considering the merits/demerits of the individual case.

                                        The credits can be transferred only after the concerned student submits the grades
                                        that he has obtained in another institute. There would be two separate academic
                                        performance grade sheets – one pertaining to the academic record at The LNMIIT and
                                        the other from the academic institution where the student spends one semester.
                                        These will not be combined as it might have different evaluation system as well
                                        as grading pattern. Student can be considered for academic medal at the time of
                                        graduation, provided CGPA / SGPA at other academic institute is at least greater
                                        than that at The LNMIIT.
