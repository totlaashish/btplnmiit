                                        <p>The last century witnessed a remarkable achievements in all  spheres of human knowledge. The role of a University is to disseminate knowledge and contribute in due course of time. Following the recommendation of UGC to diversify the disciplines M.Sc  Programmes were introduced. If Physics is the backbone of knowledge then Mathematics is the language to express that. Keeping this in mind M.Sc. in Physics and M.Sc. in Math was started.</p>
                                        <h2>M.Sc. in Physics</h2>
                                        <p>In today’s multidisciplinary world of activities, engineering or technology cannot flourish without the knowledge of advanced Physics. All branches of science and engineering are somehow or other related to Physics.</p>
                                        <p>To unravel the mysteries of Physics, one would require a certain amount of high quality education and training. A Master's Programme in Physics, with a duration of 2 years, provides students the fundamental knowledge of advanced physics, along with problem-solving skills, and most importantly a thirst for acquiring further knowledge.</p>
                                        <p>After completion of such Programme, students typically choose careers in science or engineering research, academic jobs, careers in information technology, or entrepreneurship.</p>

                                        <h2>M.Sc. in Math</h2>
                                        <p>Mathematics is primarily concerned with logical deduction and abstraction. The logical deduction aspect helps to think systematically and argue in an irrefutable manner. The abstraction aspect, on the other hand, helps to identify the absolutely essential issues and the inter-relations among them. Both these aspects, logical deduction and abstraction, play an important role in Information Technology also.</p>
