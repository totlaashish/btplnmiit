                                way. The names of all the candidates will be listed according to the decreasing
                                number of first preference points received by them. If more than candidates receive
                                225 or more first preference points, then the first m candidates of the list will
                                be declared elected, giving the required number of Senators representing the batch.
                                Otherwise, those getting 225 or more points will be declared elected, and the rest
                                will be listed again according to the first and second preference points together.
                                Now, 225 points of the first iteration will be replaced by 350 points and the procedure
                                repeated. In case m Senators are still not elected, then the third preference points
                                will also be considered and the required number of successful candidates declared
                                on the basis of all the first, second, and third preference points. </li>
